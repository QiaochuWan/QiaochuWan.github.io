					<b> High-efficiency polariton Laser</b><br>We have placed a van der Waals homostructure, formed by
					stacking three two-dimensional layers of WS2 separated by insulating hBN, similar to a
					multiple-quantum well structure, inside a microcavity, which facilitates the formation of
					quasiparticles known as exciton-polaritons. The polaritons are a combination of light and matter,
					allowing laser emission to be enhanced by nonlinear scattering, as seen in prior polariton lasers.
					In the experiments reported here, we have observed laser emission with an ultralow threshold. The
					threshold was approximately 59 nW/Î¼m2, with a lasing efficiency of 3.82%. These findings suggest a
					potential for efficient laser operations using such homostructures.

					<b>Magneto-optic and electronic characterization of quaternion state in TMD bilayers</b><br>
					Previous experimental and theoretical work has given evidence of the existence
					of doubly charged exciton states in strongly screened bilayers of transition metal
					dichalcogenide (TMD) layers. These complexes are important because they can,
					in principle, undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), in which case they
					would also be a new type of superconductor, carrying net charge. In this paper
					we present key electrostatic and magnetic measurements that definitively con-
					firm the existence of these charged boson complexes. These include 1. continuous
					control of the doping density with both positive and negative carriers, showing
					the expected population dependence on the free carrier density, and 2. measure-
					ment of the dependence on magnetic field, showing that time-reversal symmetry
					is broken for these complexes, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These
					results imply that it is promising to look for BEC and superconductivity in this
					system.
